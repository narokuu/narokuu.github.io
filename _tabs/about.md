Hi! My Name Is Naro! I will use this platform to document my Homelab and some of my career IT Projects. This will be a  source for notes, code, bugs etc.

EXTREME Shout out to [TechnoTim](https://www.youtube.com/technotimlive) For the guides, documentation, and love for homelabbing. Please check out his YouTube and subscribe!
